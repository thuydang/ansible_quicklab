Default variable details
========================

Some of ``debops.dnsmasq`` default variables have more extensive
configuration than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and
examples for them.

dnsmasq__dhcp_hosts
-------------------
``dnsmasq__dhcp_hosts`` must be a list of hosts. Each host is a dictionary
consisting of a ``name``, a ``mac`` address, an ``ip`` address and optionally a
``lease_time``; by default it's 1 day (``1d``).::

    dnsmasq__dhcp_hosts:
      - name: client
        mac: '01:23:45:67:89:ab'
        ip: '192.168.0.42'
        # optional; default: 1d
        lease_time: 12h
