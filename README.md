Ansible scripts for creating VMs for quick lab using kvm. All resources are created in this 
directory.

= Scenario: 
The idea is to start a few VMs on a host (localhost) and automatically setup these VMs to form a virtual infrastructure
e.g., OpenStack.

= Steps:
1. Preparing virtual network using bridge, tun, tap

2. Provisioning VMs

3. Custom scripts for VMs installation

= Roles:
== kvm_host_setup: 
* Install packages on kvm host

== kvm_network: 
* create bridges and tap/tun interfaces for the VMs
* The variables allows to see how the network is configured (default/main.yml):

== kvm_manage: 
* Start the vms
* The variables: 


= Design decisions:
* Inventory files hold hosts group, each of which has a playbook, e.g., baremetal inventory, baremetal.yml

= Usage:

ansible-playbook -i inventory_file site.yml --limit tutorial_hosts
ansible-playbook -i inventory_file  tutorial.yml

ansible localhost -i inventory/vfoss_dev -m alternatives -a "link=/usr/bin/psql name=pgsql-psql path=/usr/pgsql-9.4/bin/psql" -s -vvvv
